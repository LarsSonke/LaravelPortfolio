    <p>I barely have any experience with programming or coding, besides a few preparation assignments about javascript
      and html.
      Besides that I have seen my friends working on their code for their games but back then I did not get anything
      that they were doing,
      eventhough I did think it was really interesting. That is all the experience I have so far.</p>
